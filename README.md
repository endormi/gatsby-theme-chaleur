# Gatsby-Theme-Chaleur

This is my first gatsby-theme so this is highly experimental. 
Be sure to test this out and feature requests, issues and pull requests are highly appreciated.

## Installation

Install through npm.js (coming soon)

## Usage

```jsx
// gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
    __experimentalThemes: ['gatsby-theme-chaleur']
}
```

Include the theme inside your sites `gatsby-config.js` and put in `__experimentalThemes` to use the theme.
